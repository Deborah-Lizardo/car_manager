# 🚗 Car Manager

This project consists of implementing two C programs to manage car information. The goal is to handle car data using different data structures and files, providing storage, querying, and filtering functionalities.

## 📋 Description

- **P1:**  
  Reads a CSV file containing car records (brand, model, year, mileage, and price), stores this data in a linked list, and saves everything to a binary file.

- **P2:**  
  Reads the binary file generated by P1, loads the data into a dynamic array, and creates auxiliary structures to facilitate searches and filters:  
  - Linked list of years, with sublists of cars by year.  
  - Binary search trees for sorting by mileage and price.

The program presents an interactive menu that allows the user to:  
- Display all cars.  
- Search cars by substring in the model, ordered by price.  
- Filter cars by minimum year.  
- Filter cars by mileage range.  
- Filter cars by price range.  
- Exit the program.

## 💻 Technologies and Concepts Used

- C language  
- CSV and binary file handling  
- Linked lists  
- Dynamic arrays  
- Binary search trees  
- Manual memory management  

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Compile programs P1 and P2.  
2. Run P1 to generate the binary file from the CSV.  
3. Run P2 to interact with the data and perform searches and filters.
